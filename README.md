## Introduction: 
This repository contains notebooks, graphs, data, and a general audience PDF reports related to EDA Final Project. Our project topic is about "Car Accidents in 2022". Most of the data is being stored in the `/data/` folder. Generated graphs are stored in the `/graph/` folder.

- `01-Car-Accident-Analysis.ipynb`: This notebook is overview analysis on car accidents throughout the US and South Carolina. This notebook will cover general analysis on US car accidents and an in-depth analysis on South Carolina: covering weather analysis, sunset/sunrise analysis and prediction model to predict car accident's severity.
